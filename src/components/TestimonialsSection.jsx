    text: `It was a pleasure mentoring and working closely with Raghav Narayan during his internship at NVIT. From the very beginning, Raghav demonstrated a strong foundation in full-stack development, AI integration, and scalable cloud systems. What impressed me most was his ability to quickly grasp complex technical concepts and apply them to real-world, high-impact projects.

Raghav contributed significantly to mission-critical platforms such as iLMS (Integrated Local Government Management System), where he played a key role in implementing liveness detection, geofencing, and robust CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps and Docker. His work not only improved our platform's performance and reliability but also highlighted his initiative and deep technical acumen.

Beyond technical skill, Raghav is a natural problem-solver and a collaborative team player. He consistently sought feedback, iterated rapidly, and delivered quality code under tight deadlines. His curiosity, work ethic, and drive to grow stood out in every interaction.

Iâ€™m confident Raghav will make a valuable contribution to any engineering or AI-focused team. I highly recommend him without reservation and look forward to seeing all the great things he will accomplish in his career.`,

He is professional in his work, has a genuine interest in learning, and takes complete ownership even under tough circumstances. He is good at managing and prioritizing his time and work, and he is the kind of guy who doesn't need a push or supervision and he can be on his own entirely. I wish you all the very best for your next endeavors.`,
